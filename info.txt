deployment React


Deploy Your React App on Vercel
Step 1: Install Vercel CLI
First, install the Vercel CLI on your system if you havenâ€™t already.

npm install -g vercel

Step 2: Initialize Vercel in Your React Project
Navigate to your React project folder and run:

vercel login

vercel

It will prompt you to log in to Vercel using GitHub, GitLab, or email.

After logging in, run vercel again to deploy.

Choose the following options:
Framework: Select React
Directory to deploy: build
Configure default settings?: Yes
Vercel will build and deploy your React app. After completion, it will give you a public URL like:

example:
https://your-app.vercel.app

Step 3: Push to GitHub for Automatic Deployments
Vercel automatically deploys apps when you push to GitHub. If your code is not in GitHub yet:

Initialize a Git repo

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push it to GitHub

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
Connect GitHub to Vercel
Go to Vercel Dashboard
Click New Project â†’ Import your GitHub repo
Click Deploy
Now, every time you push to GitHub, Vercel will automatically redeploy ðŸš€
